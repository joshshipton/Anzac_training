# The Goldbach Conjecture states that any even number greater than 3 can be expressed as the sum of two primes
# (primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: themselves and 1). It has never been proven for all even
# numbers, but it has been demonstrated to be true for all of the numbers that we’ll use for this problem. Consider
# any even integer x > 3. There may be many pairs of primes which sum to x. Take the pair with the largest
# difference. That difference must be even, and less than x. So, repeat the trick. How many steps does it take until
# you reach an even number less than 3 (2 or 0)?
# Input
# Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
# Each test case will consist of a single line with a single integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 106, x is even).
# Output a single integer, which is the count of Repeating Goldbach steps until the number is less than 3.
