# Emilio’s team is competing at the South Pacific ICPC Divisional Finals. They have read the problems and immediately know all the solutions.
# Emilio finds simply winning the contest boring. Instead, he has convinced
# his team to spell out a word with their submissions. He has put together a
# list of n words that he would like to spell.
# Each question in the contest is labelled with an uppercase letter. The
# first question is labelled “A”, the second is labelled “B”, and so on. A word
# is spelled by solving questions in a specific order. For example, if Emilio’s
# team wants to spell LEAK, the team first solves problem L, then problem E, then problem A, and finally problem
# K. The team may only solve each problem once, so they may not spell words with duplicated letters (for example,
# they cannot spell EMILIO). Which words can Emilio’s team spell?
# Input
# The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), which is the number of words in Emilio’s list, and m (1 ≤
# m ≤ 15), which is the number of questions in the contest.
# The next n lines describe the words. Each of these lines contains a word with at least 1 and at most 15
# uppercase letters. All the words are distinct.
